= Deploying Python Containers with Gunicorn to OpenShift

== Using the OpenShift Registry as Your Enterprise Registry (PoC style)

If you want to use the OpenShift registry as the main registry (no enterprise, docker, or quay registry) Here is how to configure that. See the actual documentation link at the bottom of this page.

First you must `oc login` as a cluster-admin, in order to create the path to the registry. The registry is not accessible outside of the cluster by default. It is really intended to be a downstream caching registry

oc login -u user30 <api.clustername.something.com>

Here is an example: 

[source,bash]
$ oc login -u opentlc-mgr -p 'r3dh4t1!' https://api.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com:6443

You will be asked to accept and insecure connection because of the default self-signed certificates in the deployment of a PoC OpenShift. Please answer (y)

Next we need to see if there is an external route to the registry.

=== Exposing the registry

The documentation on how to expose the registry is :link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/registry/securing-exposing-registry.html[here] for version 4.6. 

First determine that there isn't a route to the registry already

[source,bash]
$ oc get routes -n openshift-image-registry

If this comes back empty, proceed to the next step

[source,bash]
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge

Now you should see the registry route on the next run of this command:

[source,bash]
$ oc get routes -n openshift-image-registry

yields:

```
default-route   default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com          image-registry   <all>   reencrypt     None
```

That second entry above, happens to be our route to our exposed internal registry.

Now we need to provide our user the privileges of using the registry. Two roles, `registry-editor`, and `registry-viewer` determine who and how a user can use of the registry.

[source,bash]
$ oc whoami     # the opentlc-mgr happens to be cluster-admin on my system, verify that is who you are.

```
opentlc-mgr
``` 

Now use the `oc policy` command to assign privileges of writing to the registry, and reading (deploying) from the registry:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor user30

$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer user30
----

=== Using the Registry for Direct Pushes

Suppose we want to start up an application that is a runnable container image. In this case, it is a Docker format linux container (OCI) I created with podman in the chapter on persistent storage.

Let's log into OpenShift and the Registry with our regular but "registry" enabled user: 

[source,bash]
$ oc login -u user30 -p `r3dh4t1!` https://api.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com:6443

Now for podman to log into the registry:

[source,bash]
$ podman login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) --tls-verify=false default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com  

WARNING: Do not forget the `--tls-verify=false` parameter. The OpenShift platform as deployed for Proof of Concepts and workshops usually has self-signed certificates.

We will get a `login succeeded` response from the above command.

Pushes to the registry must occur within a "project" or "namespace". Let's create a new project

[source,bash]
$ oc new-project user30-python-containers --description="Python Containers Practice"

Now we are ready to tag and push our image. Let's see what we have on the system. I have one image that was prepared using the s2i command. Source to image which assembles a python flask app onto a builder image, and automatically provides and configures `gunicorn` as a WSGI gateay.

image:python_image.png[Here is a simple python gunicorn app image]

Let's tag the image so that it can go into the OpenShift Registry. 
WARNING: You have to push an image into a subdirectory of the registry, meaning a specific project.

We created the project above. If you recall it is user30-python-containers. Now we need to tag the image to match the registry host and that project. We can tag it by the current repository and tag fields, or just our IMAGE ID. I'll do the IMAGE ID.

[source,bash]
$ oc tag 4ce16da61605 default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com/user30-python-containers/python-data-list:v1

Once the image is tagged, we can push to that remote registry via the remote repository plus the tag:

[source,bash]
$ podman push default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com/user30-python-containers/python-data-list:v1


The result will be that the image, will be pushed to the registry, and it will look something like this:

```
[jbarlow@podman ~]$ podman push default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com/user30-python-containers/python-data-list:v1

```

We can now deploy this image from the webgui or the command line interface.

Let's do this through the webgui. Note that we have selected the `Developer` persona in the upper left, and that we are in the `user30-python-container` project

image::service_catalog.png[alt="Service Catalog",align="center"]

An empty project offers up the service catalog when there is no topology to display. Note that once we select internal registry, we are offered drop downs for our image and tag. Fill in the whole form, and press `Create`

image:registry-container-deploy.png[How it is done!]

The second entry on that line is the URL to our application, in this case accessible via http

When we created this container, we used Red Hat's s2i process and we built it in link:./building_python_containers.adoc[this s2i build lab exercise] 

That build method is supposed to automatically detect the application, and launch it with the Gunicorn WSGI HTTP server. 

Let's log into the pod and see what is actually running:

If you hit the link to the running pod, you will get a response:
image:running-container.png[]

Following that link will provide the following response in the browser:

image::hello-world-browser.png[]

How can we be sure that this "automatically" implemented a deployment with Gunicorn?  Let's log into the pod and verify:


```
$ oc get pods

```
We see that indeed, there are multiple threads of Gunicorn running our Flask application.

== Source to Image (s2i) Build Within OpenShift

Another method to deploy containers without an "upstream" registry is to build the container image automatically _within_ OpenShift
