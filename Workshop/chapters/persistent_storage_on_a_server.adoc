= Persistent Storage on a Server

link:../containers.adoc[Return to workshop top page]

It is time to look at two approaches to getting files access for your containerized Python application.

1) mounting external drives to the container at *run-time*

2) Copying files into the container at *container build time* 

== Mounting Volumes and Security

Mounting data file directories for access by a containerized application is pretty easy. Making sure the security works for the platform is essential.

SELinux extensions for Linux servers have been around for almost 20 years now. Not using them is no longer a viable option in most companies.

It is common to make mount points in the /mnt directory. I'm going to do this in my home directory, however.

This directory will hold data files in the server filesystem, and make no attempt to copy them "into the container"

[source,bash]
$ mkdir datafiles
$ touch data{1..20}.txt
$ touch values{1..30}.csv

This will provide some files to observe within our "app"

Letâ€™s get the SELinux security context correct:

[source,bash]
$ sudo chcon -Rt container_file_t datafiles
$ sudo restorecon ./datafiles

We have modified our application slightly in order to return a list of files as astring that the container may access

[source,bash]
--
cat > testapp.py <<UNTILHERE
import sys
import os
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_restful import Resource, Api

application = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(application)

class Greeting (Resource):
    def get(self):
        return 'Hello Another World from a generic Universal Base Image optimized for RHEL! try hitting this resource at /python_version'

class PythonVersion (Resource):
    def get(self):
        return (sys.version)

class ListFiles (Resource):
    def get(self):
        file_list = os.listdir( '/datafiles' )
        listToStr = ' '.join(map(str, file_list))
        return listToStr

api.add_resource(Greeting, '/')
api.add_resource(PythonVersion, '/python_version')
api.add_resource(ListFiles, '/data_files')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    application.run('0.0.0.0','8080')
UNTILHERE
--

This file should be placed into the following directory:

[source,bash]
$ cp testapp.py s2i-python-container/examples/setup-test-app/testapp.py
$ cd s2i-python-container
$ git commit -am "added file listing in the data volume"
$ git push

Now the container can be re-built 

[source,bash]
$ sudo s2i build https://github.com/jimbarlow/s2i-python-container.git --context-dir=3.9/test/setup-test-app/ quay.io/jdbarlow/python39:latest python-data-list

Now to run this, we will add a new parameter to the docker command line, the -v for volume mounting. This is a colon separated value pair, just as with the ports. This requires a full path of the server directory first, followed by the ":" and the internal directory to mount in the pod.  I added the -d to detach the container from the terminal console.

[source,bash]
$ sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /home/student/datafiles:/datafiles python-data-list

Now you can curl the `localhost:8080/data_files` URL to see if you can see the mounted data. These mounts can are read/write by default.

== Copying Data Into the Container Filesystem

Here is our second option. At the time we build the container, we can use the COPY command from the "Dockerfile" to copy the files into the overlay file system that the container uses directly.

Let's go back to our first container image for this one for the sake of simplicity

[source,bash]
mkdir -p src
cat > Dockerfile.copyfiles <<UNTILHERE
FROM python:3.9-buster
COPY ./requirements.txt /application/requirements.txt
# Here we will copy in our data directory
COPY ./datafiles /datafiles
# We'll eventualy have to figure out how to get results out
WORKDIR /application
RUN python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY ./src /application/src
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["src/main.py"]
UNTILHERE

Our application will have to deliver the results outside of the filesystem. Perhaps as a POST someplace?

[source,python]
--
cat > src/main.py <<UNTILHERE
import sys, os
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_restful import Resource, Api

application = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(application)

class Greeting (Resource):
    def get(self):
        return 'Hello World from a generic Universal Base Image optimized for RHEL! try hitting this resource at /python_version'

class PythonVersion (Resource):
    def get(self):
        return (sys.version)

class ListFiles (Resource):
    def get(self):
        return(os.listdir( '/datafiles' ))

api.add_resource(Greeting, '/')
api.add_resource(PythonVersion, '/python_version')
api.add_resource(ListFiles, '/data_files')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    application.run('0.0.0.0','8080')

UNTILHERE
--

Just for grins, I thought we would return the list rather than the string in this chapter.

Our requirements.txt stay the same, though we will not use gunicorn here.

Let's build:

[source,bash]
$ podman build -f Dockerfile.copyfiles -t copy-files-into

Let's run:

[source,bash]
$ podman run --rm -p 8080:8080 copy-files-into

Please curl:

[source,bash]
$ curl localhost:8080/data_files

Do you see the files returned as a list object?
