=== Red Hat Sources

The following is an extensive tutorial that I recently found. It includes examples with databases:

This URL references C#, but Don's articles explain basic containers suitable for servers and OpenShift on many languages:

The following is Graham Dumpleton's blog article on "Hello World" on Python on OpenShift
