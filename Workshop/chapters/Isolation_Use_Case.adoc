= The Python Isolation Use Case

== System vs. Application Python Instances
We all know that it is not good to use the "system python." In some cases it is tied to the install and maintenance utilities. If you link /usr/bin/python -> /usr/bin/python37 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), yum (installation, updates) utilities break. 

RHEL 7 is installed with 2.7.5 with patches applied for bugs and security. RHEL can have installed Python3, which in version 7 translates to Python 3.6.3. Red Hat Software Collections repositories include up to Python 3.8 

A container can easily built through to hold up to 3.9.0 on a Fedora "builder image", or on 3.9.1 as of today, from the Python Developers.
