=== Red Hat Sources

The following is an extensive tutorial that I recently found. It includes examples with databases:

This URL references C#, but Don's articles explain basic containers suitable for servers and OpenShift on many languages:

Red Hat has been running a series of informal "live coding" events on the topic of containers on openshift.tv (Twitch and Youtube). This is called TLH (The Level-up Hour) by Langdon White.
