= Deploying Python Containers with Gunicorn to OpenShift

== Using the OpenShift Registry as Your Enterprise Registry (PoC style)

If you want to use the OpenShift registry as the main registry (no enterprise, docker, or quay registry) Here is how to configure that. See the actual documentation link at the bottom of this page.

First you must `oc login` as a cluster-admin, in order to create the path to the registry. The registry is not accessible outside of the cluster by default. It is really intended to be a downstream caching registry

oc login -u user30 <api.clustername.something.com>

Here is an example: 

[source,bash]
$ oc login -u opentlc-mgr -p 'r3dh4t1!' https://api.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com:6443

You will be asked to accept and insecure connection because of the default self-signed certificates in the deployment of a PoC OpenShift. Please answer (y)

Next we need to see if there is an external route to the registry.

=== Exposing the registry

The documentation on how to expose the registry is here for version 4.6. 

[source,bash]
oc get routes -n openshift-image-registry

If no routes are listed, proceed.

Here is the command to patch the registry operator to generate a default (not very pretty) functional route:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge

$ oc get routes -n openshift-image-registry
----
yielded as the route:

```
default-route   default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com
```

=== Grant the users permissions to the registry

We will be granting rights to user30 in this example. registry-editor allows for pushing to the registry, and registry-viewer allows use of the registry.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc whoami
opentlc-mgr 
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor user30
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer user30
----

=== Using the Registry for Direct Pushes

Pushes to the registry must occur within a "project" or "namespace". Let's create a new project

[source,bash]
$ oc new-project user30-python-containers --description="Python Containers Practice"

Suppose we want to start up an application that is a runnable container image. In this case, it is a Docker format linux container (OCI) I created with podman in the chapter on persistent storage.

Let's log into OpenShift and the Registry with our regular but registry permissions bound user: 

[source,bash]
$ oc login -u user30 -p 'r3dh4t1!'  https://api.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com:6443

Then log into the registry with podman. We will use the user token for the password, and we will log into the route for the registry

[source,bash]
$ podman login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) --tls-verify=false default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com  

TIP: Do not forget the `--tls-verify=false` parameter. The OpenShift platform as deployed for Proof of Concepts and workshops usually has self-signed certificates.

We will get a `login succeeded` response from the above command.

Now we are ready to push our image. Let's see what we have on the system. I have one image that was prepared using the s2i command. Source to image which assembles a python flask app onto a builder image, and automatically provides and configures `gunicorn` as a WSGI gateay.

IMAGE:python-image.png[Here is a simple python gunicorn app image]

Let's tag the image so that it can go into the OpenShift Registry. 
WARNING: You have to push an image into a subdirectory of the registry, meaning a specific project.

First we will create the project, and then tag the image to match that project.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project python-containers

$ podman tag quay.io/jdbarlow/python-data-list:v1 default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com/user30-python-containers/python-data-list:v1

$ podman push default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com/user30-python-containers/python-data-list:v1
----

The result will be the image, which is ready to be pushed to the registry:

```
[jbarlow@podman ~]$ podman images
REPOSITORY                                                                                                                        TAG   IMAGE ID       CREATED      SIZE
quay.io/jdbarlow/python-data-list                                                                                                 v1    4ce16da61605   8 days ago   1.04 GB
default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com/user30-python-containers/python-data-list   v1    4ce16da61605   8 days ago   1.04 GB
[jbarlow@podman ~]$ 
```

Now for the actual push:

[source,bash]





```
--> Found container image 67d3724 (36 minutes old) from quay.io for "quay.io/jdbarlow/big-test-py:v6"

    * An image stream tag will be created as "big-test-py:v6" that will track this image

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "big-test-py" created
    deployment.apps "big-test-py" created
    service "big-test-py" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/big-test-py' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

TIP: To access the image from a browser or a curl command, follow the recommendation from the above to create a route that is linked to the service:
```
oc expose svc/big-test-py
```
To see the route, use the get command

```
oc get routes
```
big-test-py   big-test-py-user30-python-containers.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com          big-test-py   8080-tcp 
```

The second entry on that line is the URL to our application, in this case accessible via http

== Pushing to the OpenShift Registry


return to your normal user status

$ oc login -u user30


 $ podman login -u `oc whoami` -p `oc whoami -t` default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com --tls-verify=false

 $ podman tag 4b268aa9e073 default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com/user30-python-containers/plone:v1

podman push default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.cluster-c4fe.c4fe.sandbox1777.opentlc.com/user30-python-containers/plone:v1
