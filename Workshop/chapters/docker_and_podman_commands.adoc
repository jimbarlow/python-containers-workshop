= Docker and Podman Commands -- an Introduction

== Hello World from Docker

We are going to install the docker daemon into our RHEL in order to run some of these exercises

[source,bash]
$ sudo yum install docker -y

Here is our success indicator:

image:docker_installed.png[Docker Installed]

Our next step is to start and enable the docker daemon on this system

[source,bash]
--
$ sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo systemctl status docker
--

This is what we wan to see: acitve(running)

image:docker-running.png[It is alive!]

Now for the test, the helloworld is the classic docker daemon test of the system


[source,bash]
$ sudo docker run hello-world

== So, What about Podman?

podman, buildah, and skopeo are tools meant for people who have a couple of concerns.

  1) They don't want a monolithic privileged "all purpose" daemon that required root equivalent privileges for developers

  2) Concerns about mismatch between versions of the docker daemon and Kubernetes distributions.

These concerns have been addressed, over the last couple of years by the creation of the crio tools (those we will talk about today), and a reworking of replacing the docker daemon with "containerd" for many use cases.

Either one of these approaches result in containers that are standardized to CRE (Container Runtime Initiative), and in the end both strategies result in the container being run by the "runc" executive process on Linux

Podman is introduced here as a plug-in replacement for Docker, and it is used particularly in RHEL 8.x

You can read more about it link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/why-red-hat-investing-cri-o-and-podman[here], but as an end-user or kubernetes user, either does the same thing.

== Installing Podman

[source,bash]
$ sudo yum install podman -y

That's it, there is no daemon to enable or start.

So let's redo the "hello-world" exercise with podman:

[source,bash]
$ podman run hello-world

NOTE: We did not run with sudo on the above command. podman can run containers rootless.

Here is the result of that run:

image:hello-world-podman.png[It's the same as with docker]

Please note, when I created this screenshot, I had already had this image on my machine. You will have seen podman go through a list of sources, before getting this "official community python" container image from dockerhub.  We'll have more on these repositories later.

The "Hello from Docker!" response came from the same source image container despite using podman rather than docker. Podman and Docker are basically identical in operation.

=== Podman ps

This will show us the running containers, containers run as Linux processes, so the ps (process status) command terminology is appropriate.

[source,bash]
$ podman ps

Shows nothing is running:

image:podman-ps.png[Nothing to see here, folks!]

[source,bash]
$ podman ps -a   # -a means (all)

Shows this result:

image:podman-ps-a.png[There was an image left on the machine]

This shows there is a stopped "container" on the machine.

tip: A stopped container can be restarted with the start flag on docker or podman

Please note the reference to the IMAGE in the second column `docker.io/library/hello-world:latest`. This shows the repository from which it came, allong with the tag, the implicit `latest`.

Let's take a look at the images on the machine:

image:podman-images.png[Here they are] 

We'll see as we go along that many containers may shae the same image for their container.

To clean up, we'll 

=== Podman Run

So, we saw the obligatory hello-world, that validated our environment. Now let's play with more interesting containers and learn some commands

[source,bash]
podman run -it --rm python:3.9-buster 


Did this bring you to the REPL prompt?

image::REPL-prompt.png[REPL Prompt]

the -it (Interactive Terminal) flag allows one to type within the REPL console. Go ahead, and type "import os" of you feel the need!

[source,python]
 >>> quit()

The `--rm` flag removed the container once it is stopped.  This is extremely handy when one is building containers, and a change is needed. There is no need to go into the terminal and delete the container in order to reuse the container name.


Do a `podman ps` command. You should see no containers running:

image:docker-ps.png[podman ps command]

TIP: Should we want to temporarily disconnect from this running container, and come back, (regardless of the --rm flag), do this. From the container connection, issue a ctrl-p ctrl-q. To come back, issue the `docker attach <container-name>` command. Hit `<enter>` if you do not immediately see the connection.

=== Docker container removal

To remove a container that is stopped, first identify it with the `podman ps -a` command.

The container can be removed by using the 

[source,bash]
$ podman rm
